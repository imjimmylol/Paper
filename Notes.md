1. 傳統經濟學依賴Walrasian equilibrium，ABM中拔掉Walrasian Auctioneer。
2. Walrasian Auctioneer has to
be replaced by agent-driven procurement processes。(市場結清條件，瓦拉斯拍賣者？)
3. 至少需要以下幾點以確保circular flow between firms and consumers over time （感覺這幾個點對ABM蠻重要的）
    - Terms of Trade: Firms must determine how their price and production levels will be
set.
    - Seller-Buyer Matching: Firms and consumers must engage in a matching process that
puts potential sellers in contact with potential buyers.
    - Rationing: Firms and consumers must have procedures in place to handle excess de-
mands or supplies arising from the matching process.
    - Trade: Firms and consumers must carry out actual trades.
    - Settlement: Firms and consumers must settle their payment obligations.
    - Shake-Out: Firms that become insolvent and consumers who fail to satisfy their sub-
sistence consumption needs must exit the economy.
